# Applicant-Day-Range-Finder-Resources
Information regarding the range finder circuit activity built on applicants day

Hello! I hope you enjoyed the lab activity session which introduced you to practical electronics, where you assembled, soldered and used the Arduino IDE to load code onto you board.

These resources will help you carry on investigating and modifying the software. Remember the Arduino IDE can be downloaded and used for free from their website. 

Kind regards,

Jason
